Biased Dice

roll two dice 1000 times and you will know if it is biased. this project rolls 2 die, one with equal chances to land on any of its sides verses a biased die that is more likely to land on a 6 (out of 6). produce the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of summation as well as tell the amount of double 6's. this will also produce a histograph of the distribution and potential distribution function (PDF) of both rolls after the 1000 rolls
